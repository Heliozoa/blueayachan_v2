## General Usage
### Runtypes (A new feature in Version 2!!!)
* '!': GENERIC COMMAND - Is supposed to produce similar functionality to the previous bot. When in doubt use this!
* '?': HELP COMMAND - Should give information and help regarding that command. If you need help using a specific command run it with this!
* '#': SPECIAL COMMAND - Does the standard command with different functionality that is specific to the command itself.
